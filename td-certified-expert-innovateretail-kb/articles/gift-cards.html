        Gift cards can be purchased online and redeemed at checkout. The balance
        on a gift card can be checked anytime via your account portal. Digital
        delivery ensures fast and convenient gifting.

      <h2>Gift Card Topics</h2>

      <h3>Purchase</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Gift cards can be purchased directly through our online store and are
          delivered digitally via email — no physical card is mailed.
        </li>
        <li>
          After completing your order, the recipient will receive an email
          containing the card value, personalized message (if added), and a
          unique redemption code.
        </li>
        <li>
          Digital delivery typically occurs within minutes, though in rare cases
          it can take up to one hour depending on email provider delays.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Redeem</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          During checkout, enter your gift card code in the
          <strong>Payment</strong> section before submitting your order.
        </li>
        <li>
          The balance available on the card will automatically apply to your
          total. If your purchase exceeds the card amount, you can pay the
          remaining balance with any other accepted payment method.
        </li>
        <li>
          Gift cards can be redeemed on both desktop and mobile checkout
          experiences.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Balance</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          You can view your current gift card balance anytime by signing in to
          your My Account page and selecting <strong>Gift Cards</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>Balances update instantly after each purchase or refund.</li>
        <li>
          If you received your card via email but don’t have an account, you can
          still check the balance by following the
          <strong>“Check Balance”</strong> link in your gift card email.
        </li>
      </ul>
