            <td>Gift cards can be purchased directly through our online store and are delivered digitally via email—no physical card is mailed.
After completing your order, the recipient will receive an email containing the card value, personalized message (if added), and a unique redemption code.
Digital delivery typically occurs within minutes, though in rare cases it can take up to one hour depending on email provider delays.</td>

          <tr>
            <td>Redeem</td>
            <td>During checkout, enter your gift card code in the Payment section before submitting your order.
The balance available on the card will automatically apply to your total. If your purchase exceeds the card amount, you can pay the remaining balance with any other accepted payment method.
Gift cards can be redeemed on both desktop and mobile checkout experiences.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Balance</td>
            <td>You can view your current gift card balance anytime by signing in to your My Account page and selecting Gift Cards.
Balances update instantly after each purchase or refund.
If you received your card via email but don’t have an account, you can still check the balance by following the “Check Balance” link in your gift card email.</td>
